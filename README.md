# Diffrent mechanics and how/where they are implemented
## GrapplingHook
### Pull towards
The first implementation of grapplinghook is the pull towards, in level 1. With this implementation leftclick sets a grapplingpoint. Once a point has been set you can press the right shift button to drag to that position, letting go of shift then lets the normal gravity take over again.
### Swing rope
The second implementation of grapplinghook is the swingrope, in level 2. With this implementation leftclick shoots out a grapplinghook that sticks to the first collider it hits. the player can then swing in the rope that has been created between the player and the hook.
